<h2>Welcome to GoCalc</h2>
<p>
  This is a fun math and backend project built in <strong>Golang</strong>, created for portfolio and resume purposes.
</p>

<p>
  It features a collection of mathematical tools with a focus on clean API design and frontend integration. The backend is written in Go, using performant techniques and concurrency where appropriate.
</p>

<h3>Available Tools:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>🧮 Calculus: limits, derivatives, integrals</li>
  <li>📐 Geometry: area and perimeter of shapes</li>
  <li>🧭 Coordinate Conversion: Cartesian, Polar, and Spherical</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Feel free to explore each section using the navigation bar above. This project showcases backend service design, API handling, mathematical processing, and frontend rendering—all built from scratch.
